**Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-MySQL**

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data for a fictional Pizza Hut franchise using MySQL. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data, including basic sales metrics, trends, and advanced analytics. The project is structured into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced queries.

The data has been organized into multiple tables, and queries are used to extract insights related to order counts, revenue, popular pizza types, and more. This analysis could help a business understand customer preferences and optimize sales strategies.
